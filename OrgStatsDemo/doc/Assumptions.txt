OrgStatsTool Assumptions

There were several assumptions made related to the data, including:

- Org ids in the org hierarchy data file are unique (no duplicates).
- There are no commas in the org name.
- The user id in the user data file is unique for all users across 
  all organizations (no duplicates).
- A user id is only associated with one organization.
- OrgId and parentOrgId (except when null) and userId are numbers.
- The ordering of org and user input files are likely already sorted,
  but it isn't necessary for processing.

Other assumptions include:

- If an organization is assigned to a parent that doesn't exist, 
  it is acceptable to keep it at the top level of the org tree.
- Writing over previously created output files is acceptable.
- Assume single threaded access of the OrgCollection.

I decided to use ArrayList assuming the data files would likely already be sorted.
Also, I'm assuming the depth of the organization hierarchy is usually not very deep.  
For large data sets, over 500 million rows, the general idea of loading that much 
data into memory doesn't sound like something that could be resolved by a slightly different
Java collection implementation.  It would require storing the data in some way to be retrieved
as it is needed instead of all at once.
